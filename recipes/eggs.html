        <h4><strong>Healthy Breakfast</strong></h4>
        <p>Scrambled eggs are one of the little luxuries of everyday life</p>
        <h4><strong>Ingredients</strong></h4>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Eggs</strong></li>
            <li>Milk, plant milk, or water</li>
            <li>Extra-virgin olive oil or butter</li>
            <li>Salt</li>
            <li>Pepper</li>
        </ul>
        <h4><strong>STEPS</strong></h4>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Crack, season, and whisk in a mixing bowl</strong></li>
            <p></p>
            <li><strong>Heat some butter in a pan</strong></li>
                <p>Slice off a pat of unsalted butter and place it in a ceramic or nonstick skillet over medium-low heat. Swirl the pan until the butter has melted and is starting to foam. You should hear a very soft sizzle emanating from the pan.</p>
            <li><strong>Add your egg mixture to the pan</strong></li>
                <p>Pour the whisked eggs into the skillet and immediately start pushing them across the bottom of the nonstick pan with a rubber spatula.</p>
            <li><strong>Keep the eggs moving</strong></li>
                <p>Continue to stir the eggs with your spatula, paying attention to every corner of the skillet. Your goal here is to keep the eggs in perpetual motion. These are almost done. Keep those eggs moving and get ready!</p>
            <li><strong>Wait until the eggs begin to set</strong></li>
                <p>Your pan is still over low-medium heat, right? That's why it will take a few minutes before the eggs start to form large curds. Resist turning up the knob to high heat—the low-and-slow cooking is what makes the scrambled eggs a creamy dream.</p>
            <li><strong> Don't let your eggs dry out</strong></li>
                <p>When your eggs look like this—set, but still a bit runny—remove them from the pan. Even though they're not fully done, the eggs will continue to cook a little bit on your plate. A final hit of black pepper is all these eggs need.</p>
            <li><strong> Eat your perfect scrambled eggs!</strong></li>
                <p>That’s all you have to do. You now have perfectly scrambled eggs. We recommend topping with flaky salt—plus whatever else you want. A squeeze of lime juice, a slice of country ham, a shaving of Parmesan, some cooked spinach or, really, all of the above are welcome here.</p>
        </ol>
